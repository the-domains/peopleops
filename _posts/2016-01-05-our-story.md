Our Story? 

How much time do you have?  In late 2007, PeopleOps was unofficially launched.  Our founder, Jonah Manning, started PeopleOps at a corner stool at the barista bar at his local Starbucks. Which is fitting actually? The last company he founded and sold just a couple of years ago also launched in a Starbucks.  The original premise of PeopleOps was this:  Outsourcing services, like recruitment process outsourcing, was not more cost effective.  The basic selling strategy was to go to brands and help them understand that the dollar per hour amount does not necessarily equate directly to the CPH (cost-per-hire).  For example: If X service company, based offshore, charged two-thousand dollars per month, but did not generate candidates (by any measurable standards) that were hired and Firm Y (PeopleOps) provides a service, that is significantly more expensive, yet results in multiple hires. Which one is more effective for your company?  

This concept proved effective.  PeopleOps skyrocketed a 1400% growth rate over the next year~.  When the recession picked up in early 2009, we began to look for ways to diversify.  We discovered that our same methodology made us successful in other areas of B2B.  We started creating spin-off entities for testing purposes.  For the last several years, we have brought our delivery model and strategy to a level that, we feel, meets our brand expectations for PeopleOps.   

We are excited for the next chapter of PeopleOps, as we emerge from a boutique sourcing firm to a hyper-growth solutions and consulting firm with a focus on the following areas:

Candidate Sourcing

Retained Search

Corporate Development

Private Equity

Procurement

E-Commerce

Seller and Strategic Consulting Services
